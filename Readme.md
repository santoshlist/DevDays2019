# 1. Introduction

One of very popular and widely used Git workflows are based on features branches, which allows efficiently to collaborate. When feature branch is finished development team submits the pull request for the review before merging into the master branch.

How to be sure that the pull request will not break the master branch when dealing with microservices? Handling separate environment for each branch, environments on developers machines or/and dozens of mock-ups? That's not scalable. 

With Azure Dev Spaces and Azure Pipelines, it is possible to quickly test  PR code in the context of the broader application running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 
How to set up that workflow is explained in upcoming sections.

# 3. Workshop steps

## 3.1. Get the workshop project
Fork the workshop github repository to your Github from <https://github.com/texnokot/DevDays2019>

Clone your fork to your computer and navigate to the application directory

~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/DevDays2019.git
$ cd BikeSharingApp/
~~~~

## 3.2. Create AKS cluster with enabled Azure Dev Spaces

AKS cluster should be created in a [supported region for AKS Dev Spaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-spaces/about#supported-regions-and-configurations)

Create a resource group DevDaysOslo2019 where all resources will be located:

~~~~
$ az group create --name DevDaysOslo2019 --location westeurope
~~~~

Create an AKS cluster aksdevdays:

~~~~
$ az aks create -g DevDaysOslo2019 -n aksdevdays --location westeurope --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 --node-count 1 --disable-rbac --generate-ssh-keys
~~~~

Enable Azure Dev Spaces on created AKS cluster and dev space

~~~~
$ az aks use-dev-spaces -g DevDaysOslo2019 -n aksdevdays --space dev --yes
~~~~

## 3.3. Create Azure Container Registry

We need container registry where to store containers for AKS. Create acr *acrdevdays* by running the following command:

~~~~
$ az acr create --resource-group DevDaysOslo2019 --name acrdevdays --sku Basic
~~~~

Check that it runs successfully by login

~~~~
$ az acr login --name acrdevdays
~~~~

Grant permssions for your AKS to use ACR by running aksgrant.sh command from the cloned repository. Before running replace values with your resource group, acr and aks values. Update, save and run:

~~~~
$ ./aksgrant.sh
~~~~

## 3.4. Run the application in AKS cluster
### 3.4.1. Retrieve the HostSuffix for dev namespace
Use the `azds show-context` command to show your AKS cluster’s HostSuffix for dev. When `azds` runs first time it installs istelf in command line tool

~~~~
$ azds show-context

Name          ResourceGroup     DevSpace    HostSuffix
----------    -------------     --------    -----------
aksdevdays  DevDaysOslo2019  dev       5bsfq5jg95.weu.azds.io
~~~~

### 3.4.2. Update the Helm chart with your Host Suffix
Open *charts/values.yaml* and replace all instances of *<REPLACE_ME_WITH_HOST_SUFFIX>* with the *HostSuffix* value you retrieved earlier. Save your changes and close the file.
### 3.4.3. Run the application in Kubernetes
The commands for running the sample application on Kubernetes are part of an existing process and have no dependency on Azure Dev Spaces tooling. In this case, Helm is the tooling used to run this sample application but other tooling could be used to run your entire application in a namespace within a cluster. The Helm commands are targeting the dev space named dev you created earlier, but this dev space is also a Kubernetes namespace. As a result, dev spaces can be targeted by other tooling the same as other namespaces.

You can use Azure Dev Spaces for team development after an application is running in a cluster regardless of the tooling used to deploy it.

Use the `helm init` and `helm install` commands to set up and install the sample application on your cluster.

~~~~
$ cd charts/
$ helm init --wait
$ helm install -n bikesharing . --dep-up --namespace dev --atomic --wait
~~~~

The `helm install` command may take several minutes to complete. The output of the command shows the status of all the services it deployed to the cluster when completed:

~~~~
$ cd charts/
$ helm init --wait
...
Happy Helming!
$ helm install -n bikesharing . --dep-up --namespace dev --atomic --wait
    Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...

~~~~

Navigate to the *bikesharingweb* service by opening the public URL from the `azds list-uris` command. In the below example, the public URL for the bikesharingweb service is `http://dev.bikesharingweb.<random suffix>.weu.azds.io/`

~~~~
$ azds list-uris
    Uri                                                       Status
    --------------------------------------                    -------
    http://dev.bikesharingweb.<random suffix>.weu.azds.io/    Available
    http://dev.gateway.<random suffix>.weu.azds.io/           Available
~~~~

Navigate to the *bikesharingweb* service by opening the public URL from the `azds list-uris` command.
In the above example, the public URL for the bikesharingweb service is `http://dev.bikesharingweb.<random suffix>.weu.azds.io/`
Select Aurelia Briggs (customer) as the user. Then select a bike to rent.

## 3.5. Prepare CI/CD pipeline

If you don't have the Azure Pipelines app in your Github account already, install it from: <https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines>.

Create the project:

![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/DevOpsCreateProject.png)

Install [Github AzureDevOps Rest Api Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jikuma.devops-github-extension) extension in your Azure DevOps organization where Project was created.

In Azure DevOps under Preview features, enable *Multi-stage pipelines*:
![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/preview.png)

### 3.5.1. Create Service Connections

To create Service Connections go to *Project Settings* and choose *Service connections* under *Pipelines*. Create 4 Service Connections.
* Docker Registry (Azure Container Registry)
![Docker Registry](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/DockerRegistry.png)
* Kubernetes (Azure Subscription)
![Kubernetes](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/KubernetesService.png)
* Azure Resource Manager (Service Principal Authentication)
![Azure Resource Manager](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/AZRService.png)
* GitHub
![Github Service](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/GithubService.png)

### 3.5.2. Create a new pipeline

After you have created your Service Connections, navigate to Pipelines and create a new Pipeline. In the next step you will be asked to point to your code repository. Select GitHub and choose the repository you forked earlier.

![Github repository](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/GithubRepository.png)

Choose your forked repository. Azure Pipelines will analyze your repository content and suggest CI/CD templates.

Select *“Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file”*.

![Github placed YAML](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/PipelineExistingYaml.png)

Type the path *BikeSharingApp/Bikes/azds_pipeline.yaml* to the YAML file in the Bikes directory and continue.

![YAML](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/azds_pipeline.png)

Edit the YAML. Do following:

* Replace CONTAINER-REGISTRY-CONNECTION-NAME with the Docker Registry service connection name.
* Replace CONTAINER-REGISTRY-URL. You can find this information in the Azure Portal under your Azure Container Registry. It should look something like this: login server: devdays2019.azurecr.io.
* Replace KUBERNETES-CONNECTION-NAME with the Kubernetes service connection name.
* Replace the KUBERNETES-CLUSTER-NAME with your AKS cluster name.
* Replace the KUBERNETES-CLUSTER-RESOURCE-GROUP with your Azure Resource Group name in which you have created the cluster.
* Replace the AZURE-CONNECTION-NAME with your Azure Resource Manager service connection name.
* Replace GITHUB-CONNECTION-NAME with your GitHub service connection name.

When everything is changed, apply and run it. Explore how pipeline works: tasks and flow. The first time pipeline will build and deploy to Dev space. 

![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/InitialPipeline.png)

Trigger section in pipeline ensures that pipeline will run only when you make changes to the Bikes service. There are two stages in the pipeline, and each has a condition which ensures they run only on changes to the master branch or when a pull request is created for master.

## 3.6. Test and work with your pull requests

### 3.6.1. Create the feature branch and update the code

Create the new branch named bike-images and verify that you are on the bike-images branch:

~~~~
$ git checkout -b bike-images
$ git status
~~~~

Navigate to Bikes/server.js and remove lines:

~~~~
// Hard code image url *FIX ME*
   theBike.imageUrl = "/static/logo.svg";
~~~~

![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/file_change.png)

Stage and commit your changes to the *bike-images* branch. Push the branch to your Github:

~~~~
$ git add Bikes/server.js
$ git commit -m "Removing hard coded imageUrl"
$ git push origin bike-images
~~~~

### 3.6.2. Pull Request Flow

Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and create a new pull request. The base branch will be master and the branch you are comparing is *bike-images*. Or you should see notification with message: "Compare & pull request".

![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/compare_changes.png)

Navigate to your build pipeline and confirm it has started building the *Bikes* service.

![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/PullRequestDeploy.png)

Once the build pipeline has successfully completed, navigate back to your pull request on GitHub.
![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/GithubOutput.png)

### 3.6.3. Explore your pull request changes


Open the review app by clicking on Details to the right of the Dev Spaces review app label.

It will open website with deployed changes. Website is deployed in separate dev space.

Now that we have our changes running in a new dev space, this is a great opportunity to include team members such as product managers and designers to look over our changes and provide feedback.

Navigate back to the detail page for renting a bike. Confirm the placeholder image has been replaced with an actual image of the bike.

![](https://githubpictures.blob.core.windows.net/devopsdayspost/withpicture.png)

Merge pull request. Once the pull request is merged, the build pipeline will trigger and redeploy the parent branch to the parent dev space. In our scenario the master branch is deployed to the dev space named “dev”. You should try this exercise on your own.
